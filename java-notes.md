Java Notes (Simple)

1. Introduction

	Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language.

	Developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (1995).

	Platform-independent → "Write once, run anywhere".

	Used for web apps, mobile apps (Android), desktop apps, etc.

2. Features of Java

	Simple → easy to learn, syntax like C/C++ but simpler.

	Object-Oriented → everything is treated as objects.

	Platform-Independent → runs on JVM (Java Virtual Machine).

	Secure → no direct memory access.

	Robust → handles errors and exceptions well.

	Multithreading → multiple tasks at the same time.

	Portable → same code works anywhere.

3. Java Program Structure
	class Hello {
    		public static void main(String[] args) {
        		System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
    	}
	}


	Explanation:

	class → defines a class.

	main() → entry point of program.

	System.out.println() → prints output.

4. Basic Syntax

	Case-sensitive (Java ≠ java).

	Every statement ends with ;.

	Classes start with capital letter (naming convention).

5. Data Types

	Primitive Data Types:

	int → numbers (10, 20)

	double → decimal values (10.5)

	char → single character ('A')

	boolean → true/false

	Non-primitive: Strings, Arrays, Objects
